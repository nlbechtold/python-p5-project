## Foraging Friends

-----------
## Summary
Do you ever go on a trail and think, "Hmmm what if I get lost out here, how would I survive, what would I eat?"... I have been guilty of it more than once, so I created an app called Foraging Friends. This app will allow you to create foraging guides for you next trail that will detail edible and medicinal plants in the region. So next time you're lost, don't forget your friends.... Foraging Friends!

## Use of website
You will be sent to a log in page where you will create an account using your email and a password, after creating this, simply log in and it will direct you to the userpage, which will show all your foraging guides. From this page you can also create,edit,and delete guides.

After creating a guide you can go ahead and add plants to your guide with this handy search function. You can look for a combo of plants by their use, national park, or by state. You can then add plants and return to the home page where you will see you filled out foraging guide. 

The best part? You can email yourself the guide with a click of the button!
